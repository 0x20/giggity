This is an Android Studio project. Good luck getting your local install
to import it properly! It's a process that can either be enjoyable or
make me miss Makefiles.

Sadly Eclipse and Android Studio have done a great job at fscking up the
indentation (meant to be tabs but got mixed here and there). Maybe I'll
decrustify some day..
