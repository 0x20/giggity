DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Lizzie O’Shea\nTechnological advancement is not jus
 t about intelligent design\, clever cryptography or brilliant coding\; it
 ’s also a function of power. To make technology work for people\, we nee
 d to take this power back – and demand that the development of technolog
 y involve social\, political and ethical considerations. Protecting encryp
 tion is about protecting democracy – it is about shifting power away fro
 m states and companies and towards people. \n\nIn late 2018\, digital righ
 ts activists took on the national security establishment to try to resist 
 attacks on encryption. It was a important and spirited effort but it was u
 ltimately unsuccessful. The AABill passed\, despite it being widely-accept
 ed as a serious threat to our digital security. This talk will explain how
  that occurred\, and how the intersection of technology and politics can b
 e a challenging place for people interested in good public policy. \n\nIf 
 we are going to improve our laws and public policy in relation to technolo
 gy\, we are going to need to fight for it. This requires a broad based all
 iance. We must take highly technical debates to the mainstream. It means f
 inding ways to discuss these issues with precision but also simplicity\, w
 ith determination but also compassion. The opportunities are there provide
 d we can organise and make the most of them.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Dr Sean Brady\nAll professionals possess some measure
  of expertise\, and not only is this expertise useful\, it is usually also
  necessary to do the job. In general\, this expertise is viewed as a good 
 thing.\n\nBut what if there is an issue with expertise? Is expertise alway
 s a good thing?\n\nThis presentation will discuss how expertise has limita
 tions when it is applied outside its normal area of application\, and how 
 these limitations will typically not be evident to the individual applying
  the expertise. Further\, even in situations where evidence suggests the a
 pplication of the expertise is inappropriate\, it is likely that an indivi
 dual will continue to apply their expertise regardless of its inappropriat
 eness.\n\nTo explore these issues the presentation will examine the behavi
 our of a group of firefighters fighting a wildfire in Mann Gulch in the US
  in 1949\, it will look at psychological studies that examine the concept 
 of Priming\, and it will discuss how the game of baseball can assist in un
 ravelling why expertise can sometimes let us down.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Keith Packard\nTiny embedded computers\, like the ori
 ginal Arduino\, are great for\nautomating simple tasks. What they are not 
 great at is providing an\neasy-to-learn environment for new programmers.\n
 \nAs a part of a middle school robotics course based on Lego\, I've\ndevel
 oped a new language\, Snek\, which runs on these machines. Snek can\nrun i
 n as little as 32kB of ROM and 2kB of RAM. It provides a simpler\,\nsafer\
 , easier to explore environment than C++. Snek is a subset of the\nPython 
 language and comes with a host-based IDE written in Python that\nruns on L
 inux\, Mac OS X and Windows.\n\nThis presentation will describe the Snek l
 anguage along with a few of\nthe interesting implementation details includ
 ing:\n\n * A new parser generator\, lola\, that generates\n   a parser 1/1
 0 the size of bison\n\n * An in-place compacting garbage collector\n\n * A
  fine hack for representing values in 32 bits that includes 32-bit\n   flo
 ats\n\n * Some challenges with Python syntax and\n   semantics which make 
 it difficult to fit into a small\n   environment.\n\nThere will also be a 
 demonstration of a few Snek-based Lego robots\nalong with a description of
  how Snek has been integrated into the\nclassroom environment. Comparisons
  with other embedded Python\nimplementations will also be provided\, inclu
 ding Micro Python\, Circuit\nPython and full Python running on systems lik
 e the Raspberry PI.\n\nAttendees will learn something about how interprete
 d Python\nimplementations operate\, how Python can be used in embedded sys
 tems\nand what teaching programming to middle school students (10-14 years
 \nold) is like.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Daniel McCarthy\nHexapods are six legged robots which
  are a staple in academic and hobbyist circles due to their versatility an
 d static stability. Hexapod platforms however\, specifically six degree of
  freedom (6DOF) Hexapod kits are commonly quite expensive. Expensive enoug
 h that I couldn't afford one -- So\, I set out to build an inexpensive (or
 der of magnitude cheaper) 6DOF Hexapod.\n\nThis talk is aimed at beginner 
 and intermediate hobbyists who are interested in more advanced robotics to
 pics\, it sets out to to answer one main question: How on earth does one d
 esign and build a 6DOF Hexapod (hardware and software) from the ground up?
 \n\nIn it the design process\, challenges and trade-offs as well as how on
 e gets a Hexapod to walk without tripping over itself (inverse kinematics 
 and gait algorithms) will be examined.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Rachel Bunder\nAustralia is rolling out smart energy 
 meters to all homes. Instead of an analogue meter that needs to be physica
 lly checked each billing cycle\, a smart meter monitors your energy in 15 
 minute intervals and sends this data to your energy network providers.  Ad
 ditionally\, many people have smart home setups which often monitors your 
 home energy usage in even more detail. Even many solar systems monitors yo
 ur energy consumption. \n\nBut how much can you actually tell from this da
 ta? What could this be data used for? Who even has this data? In this talk
  I will show what energy data is actually being collected about you\, who 
 has access to it and what can be inferred from it. I will also discuss the
  wider implications of having a “smart” home and “smart” energy gr
 id.

 purebred) with the tasty-tmux framework. I'll elaborate the benefits and t
 rade-off's\, what problems we experienced and how we solved them.\n\nAutom
 ating acceptance testing is challenging\, because the tests can not adapt 
 to timing sensitive changes in the application. This causes random failure
 s and unresponsiveness. The longer these problems are ignored\, the longer
  value diminishes and investment increases for workarounds and fixes.\n\nT
 he audience will get a better understand of what it takes to automate timi
 ng sensitive tests. The concept\, problems and solutions are language agno
 stic applicable to any terminal platform and application.\n\nProject URL:

  acceptance testing and why should you automate it\n    What other choices
  of testing did we have and why we haven't chosen them\n    The effort we 
 put into automating our tests\n    What we gained with automating our acce

 the last dozen words you've heard you only recognized two\, and neither wo
 uld seem to have any bearing on the topic at hand. You look around and see
  that everyone but the presenter appears to be mentally grasping for some 
 key understanding what's being said. Your carefully gathered notes say "SD
 L PRS review SS2 Smokey Lagoon PKR BKM". Somehow\, the jargon you've relie
 d on for precise and detailed technical communication as devolved into inc
 omprehensible gibberish.\n\nCasey Schaufler\, who's been working in operat
 ing systems development for the past 40 years\, explains the reasons techn
 ical documents and presentations so often become impossible to decipher.  
 There's much more to it than the unguarded and unexplained use of acronyms
 \, abbreviations and code words. The impact of language background on the 
 use of technical terms is explored. How cultural differences between indiv
 iduals and organizations can interfere with technical communications\, and
  how that differs from general communication is discussed. What can go wro
 ng when technical documentation is mistranslated into plain language\, res
 ulting in words with completely different meaning also gets much deserved 
 attention. Casey will provide examples\, some humorous\, some maddening an
 d some otherwise which demonstrate the problems we face. In the end\, hope
 fully useful and pragmatic approaches for avoiding the worst gibberish pro
 duction are presented.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Jon Manning\nProgrammers are used to their compilers 
 catching tiny problems in their code. When you're a writer\, it's harder t
 o catch these problems. Wouldn't it be nice if you could run an error-chec
 ker on your dialogue?\n\nThis talk discusses the application of compiler o
 ptimisation and correctness checking techniques to branching narratives\, 
 which allow authors to verify the logic of their narrative independently o
 f running it in the game.\n\nYarn Spinner is an open source narrative desi
 gn tool used in many games\, including Night in the Woods (Infinite Fall /
  Finji) and OK KO: Let’s Play Heroes (Capybara Games / Cartoon Network)\
 , that allows both writers and narrative designers to write\, edit\, scrip
 t and manage their game's dialog using a simple scripting language that's 
 reminiscent of Twine. While most games devise their dialog in script form\
 , it's typically implemented using another system\, such as a spreadsheet\
 , or node-based tools. By contrast\, Yarn Spinner implements a domain-spec
 ific language designed to be easy for a non-programmer to write their dial
 ogue in\, and easy for a programmer to implement gameplay-specific behavio
 ur.\n\nCompilers for most programming languages are designed to catch comm
 on mistakes\, and give warnings where appropriate. In recent years\, tools
  for static analysis of programs - a technique where a compiler analyses t
 he behaviour of code without running it - have allowed programmers to dete
 ct subtle bugs that a simpler compiler could not. For example\, it's possi
 ble to identify a combination of branches that lead to an uninitialised va
 riable being returned from a function.\n\nBecause Yarn Spinner is a comple
 te programming language\, we are able to apply the same techniques from co
 mpiler design to assist writers. For example\, a compiler is able to analy
 se a branching narrative tree\, take into account the variables that are c
 hecked to decide what options are available\, and determine that a line of
  dialog can never be reached.\n\nThese techniques allow for more reliable 
 testing of dialogue. Testing a branching piece of dialogue often relies on
  the tester repeating a number of decisions in order to set up the necessa
 ry state\, which can be repetitive and tedious. However\, a static analyse
 r is able to identify what the values of certain variables _must be_ in or
 der for a line to be accessed\, which allows the tester to jump straight t
 o the lines under test\, skipping large amounts of per-test setup time. Th
 is allows someone who’s trying to test out a conversation to do it in re
 alistic conditions\, skipping past the repetition while also guaranteeing 
 that the state of the dialogue is the same as if they’d performed it man
 ually.\n\nIn this talk\, I’ll discuss work on Yarn Spinner that implemen
 ts symbolic execution and basic block analysis\, which allows writers to e
 asily spot problems in the implementation of their narrative\, saving deve
 lopment and testing time\, and avoiding wasted production resources.\n\nCo
 me and learn how to get started with these techniques\, and how to use the
 m in Yarn Spinner\, the open source narrative design tool!

 dwidth and memory.  However\, a lot of systems don't have those luxuries. 
  Projects as diverse as SaMBa and Nouveau have relied on decoding and infe
 rring meaning from binary data output from closed systems with no document
 ation.\n\nFor my own part\, I wanted to read the battery status from my el
 ectric motorbike (http://mabula.net/3faze/).  The 'normal' way to do this 
 is via a USB connection and a Windows program\, but this is inconvenient w
 hen you don't run Windows and definitely much harder to do when actually r
 iding the motorbike!  So I wanted a way to read and record the cell voltag
 es and overall pack status\, and even link that to GPS information so I co
 uld see how fast I was going and how much power I was drawing for a ride.\
 n\nThis talk will include actual data\, Raspberry Pis\, Grafana\, serial c
 onnections\, Python\, InfluxDB\, GPS modules and Perl - not necessarily in
  that order.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Katie Bell\nRunning .NET Framework code on Linux used
  to be something that you would approach with caution\, and only if you ne
 eded to\, especially if the code was originally written to only ever work 
 on Windows. With improvements to Mono and the release of .NET Core\, this 
 is now easier\, more reliable and more officially Microsoft supported than
  ever.\n\nAt Campaign Monitor we've got lots of Windows-specific C# .NET c
 ode\, in particular we had these 78 http-serving and background task proce
 ssing services that caused us some headaches. I and a couple of fellow eng
 ineers set out to convince management that a project to migrate them all t
 o .NET Core (on Linux) was worthwhile\, and convince them we did. I will t
 ake you through this six month project from its start as a crazy idea to i
 ts successful completion and results. We'll learn a lot about .NET Core on
  Linux and Docker\, what is easy to migrate (and what is not)\, the expect
 ed and unexpected issues we encountered and how to get a project like this
  off the ground and done.

 rengthening internal operations\, and juggling the balance of keeping an o

 rategy on community messaging and public engagement. \n\nHow can we do bet
 ter? Lyndsey entered into the world of digital rights via her campaign wor
 k building the website and social media accounts for #notmydebt\, which pr
 ovided a voice for people affected by robodebt. This campaign proved peopl

 d refuse to grant you access unless you were running an unmodified proprie
 tary operating system\, but for various reasons that turned out to not be 
 a problem in the real world. Some years later\, how can we use this attest
 ation data for the power of good?\n\nThis presentation will describe the f
 unctionality of TPMs and how the event log is generated\, and describe tec

 feature of OpenSSH\, but they offer a fantastic method to solve some pain 
 points of growing teams and growing infrastructure. You don't need to mana
 ge complicated directories to live on this greener side of the fence.\n\nH
 osts only trust a single public key of a trusted certificate authority ins
 tead of keys from every developer (and let's be honest\, several who are n
 o longer working at your company :uhoh:). SSH certificates expire (this is
  good)\, and can also tell SSH what you can or can't do with your session.
  The can even help mint a new user on a brand new trusting host. And if yo
 u need to use sudo\, don't worry your certificate's got your back too.\n\n
 How do you get short lived SSH certificates from a self service certificat
 e authority? Grab your identity on the cli using some nifty OAuth2 in your
  browser\, swap this identity to get temporary AWS credentials\, invoke a 
 lambda function\, sign a public key\, and you're on your merry way.\n\nOpe

 , and runs on a lot of stuff.  I'm sure we can all agree that this is a go
 od thing\, however the matrix of stuff it does and stuff it runs on contin
 ues to get bigger and bigger!  With thousands of commits each release and 
 a widely distributed and decentralised developer community\, how do we mak
 e sure that the kernel still works on everything\, does everything it's su
 pposed to do\, and hasn't slowed anything down in the process?\n\nIn this 
 session we're going to be looking at the huge variety of automated kernel 
 testing projects to figure out what's going on\, covering a variety of dif
 ferent areas\, including:\n\n- per-patch CI to quickly test if a developer
  broke something\,\n- built-in kernel selftests and the push for more unit
  testing\,\n- performance testing of the kernel itself and userspace\,\n- 
 regression testing\, especially for known security issues\,\n- hardware te
 sting\, from enormous 512TB machines to huge farms of small SOCs.\n\nBy un
 derstanding the huge web of projects out there\, hopefully we can figure o
 ut how we could get more stuff done more effectively.  It's a difficult pr
 oblem in the broad and uncoordinated space of Linux kernel development\, b
 ut it's all in pursuit of the dream: \n\nthe magical fantasy land - with n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Nikolai Lusan\nOpenZFS has come a long way in recent 
 times\, and with the deprecation of BTRFS we are not likely to see a files
 ystem with comparative feature set anytime soon.  The ZoL (ZFS on Linux) p
 roject is now the main source of contributions to the OpenZFS code base\, 
 and is incredibly stable and robust. With OpenZFS now supporting native en
 cryption it can simplify management of you data storage from the mdadm/luk
 s/lvm method commonly seen deployed. Other features can improve performanc
 e and allow more efficient usage of disk storage. Whether you're storing p
 ersonal files\, hosting a development environment/webserver/email/database
 \, running a virtual host\, holding large amounts of corporate data there 
 is probably a ZFS usage case for you.\n\nThis talk aims to give an outline
  of installing\, using and administering a Linux server with ZFS as the ro
 ot filesystem and for data storage. This includes:\n   * Caveats of instal
 lation and use. \n   * Benefits of ZFS.\n   * Designing/Managing storage p
 ools.\n   * Demonstration of pool creation using different disk topologies
 .\n   * Using features like native encryption\, block level compression\, 
 and database optimisation.\n   * Using snapshots\, including for off site 
 backup.\n   * ZFS and other Linux filesystems on one machine.

 hours and required semi regular manual intervention.\n\nThis talk will cov

 se of these digital collections. At AARNet we are working with our GLAM an

 re creating resources that we hope will encourage those with low (or no) c
 omputing or data science skills to take the first step. Working alongside 
 Tinker (the Humanities\, Arts and Social Sciences Data Enhanced Virtual La

  to use Jupyter Notebooks. In this paper I will introduce SWAN\, the new e

 allowed them to cheat law enforcement officials trying to crack down on ri
 de-sharing. The difference between them is that Volkswagen software engine
 ers went to jail\, and Uber software engineers didn't. Why? Because one is
  a car company\, and one is a software company.\n\nMost industries have ha
 d what we might call an "oh no" moment. It's those moments that encourage 
 industries to become better regulated\, in order to prevent further disast
 ers. The IT industry has had many moments that could be considered consequ
 ential enough to encourage better regulation\, but the changes have never 
 been made. Because the industry has avoided effective regulation for so lo
 ng\, it is possible that we are hurtling towards a disaster of epic propor
 tions\, one that we haven't even managed to conceive of yet.\n\nIn this ta

 gulation in other industries\, and the measures that were put into place t
 o mitigate the problem. I will also address some of the major moments from
  the IT industry that should have prompted regulation\, and haven't. Final

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Marcus Herstik\nFor those who have always wanted to k
 now a little about hacking this is an introduction to some of the tools av
 ailable in Kali Linux and how you can use it to check your network for sec
 urity flaws (aka vulnerabilities). As an introduction to pen-testing\, thi
 s is designed for novices who are interested in the Cyber Kill Chain\, how
  to test common systems and those wanting to know how to get started\, rat
 her than just watching videos. As such this is not intended for advanced u
 sers.\n\nMany people use tools and systems like Kali to run penetration te
 sts without really knowing what we are doing. This tutorial will introduce
  a few tools and will have a vulnerable server or two for you to launch yo
 ur attacks against ensuring this is a closer to real-life attack\, rather 
 than just theoretical.\n\nUsers will need a version of Kali Linux installe
 d or the ability to quickly copy a virtual machine (VirtualBox is the sugg
 ested software for this). Short guidance at the beginning will be provided
  for this but users will need the VirtualBox software installed.\n\nWe wil
 l start by finding the device\, then testing for vulnerabilities and attem
 pting to gain access.\nA step-by-step guide will ensure that all people ge
 t some action and hopefully a greater understanding of the mindset and com
 plexity of what it means to "hack" in to something. \n\nParticipant will n
 eed to bring their own laptop with the following minimum recommended specs
 :\n4GB RAM - 2 will be used by the VM\, 20GB HDD space\, at least 4 proces
 sors\, wireless network card\, VirtualBox or similar ( VMWare or KVM/QCOW 
 etc). Only VirtualBox will be supported and I allow 10 minutes at most for
  setup.\n\nThis tutorial will be run by one of the writers of the TAFE NSW
  Cybersecurity course and a tutor for Cybersecurity at SCU on the Gold Coa
 st.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Rafael Martinez Guerrero\nBehind every security measu
 re you take\, you should have an information management system helping you
  take decisions.\n\nIf you work with security\, you need a way to collect\
 , process\, save and analyze huge amounts of data that should be used to c
 ontrol how your systems are behaving\, find anomalies and evaluate the res
 ults of your actions.\n\nHave you ever wondered how to manage billions of 
 logs and metrics from thousands of devices in your infrastructure? If you 
 need high-availability and a resilient and stable system to process your d
 ata this is the tutorial for you. \n\nBased on the experience obtained in 
 the past 4 years at the University of Oslo processing billions of logs a d
 ay from more than 15000 devices\, this tutorial will give some inside info
 rmation and many tips about how to achieve this with Linux and open source
  software.\n\nYou will learn how to put together HAProxy\, agents\, Logsta
 sh\, Elasticsearch and RabbitMQ to work at scale. You will also hear about
  the problems and pitfalls we have experienced during these years and what
  we learned from them.\n\nThe tutorial format is a lecture with time for q
 uestions and short discussions as we move along. Due to the nature of the 
 subject treated and time available\, no hands-on or practical exercises wi
 ll be done during the lecture.\n\nThe tutorial should provide background\,
  essential theory and the details needed to enable you to work further on 
 your own afterwards.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Atish Patra\nThe momentum behind the RISC-V ecosystem
  is commendable and its open nature has an important role in its growth. A
 n unprecedented number of hardware designs were proposed by both academic 
 researchers and industry professionals in a very short period that has tak
 en the world by storm. However\, the RISC-V software ecosystem also needs 
 to grow even at a faster rate if RISC-V can be a truly competitive alterna
 tive to mainstream ISAs. The open source software ecosystem in RISC-V will
  eventually determine the success of the RISC-V platform. This talk will g
 ive an insight into the RISC-V software ecosystem evolution over the last 
 few years and the current status of major software projects. It will also 
 include future goals and some of the software projects that require more l
 ove from the community. We hope this talk will serve as a good starting gu
 ide for new/existing developers to start contributing to the RISC-V softwa
 re ecosystem. A bigger developer community will facilitate RISC-V ecosyste
 m growth even more and drive the ultimate success of the RISC-V revolution

UID:225@lca2020.linux.org.au
DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Maciej W. Rozycki\nThe RISC-V ISA provides PC-relativ
 e addressing\, which means that with hardware equipped with an MMU that su
 pports virtual memory addressing the ELF PIC psABI is straightforward and 
 does not require the use of a dedicated GOT or global data pointer (GP) re
 gister in code intended for PIE executables or DSOs\, because all static a
 ddresses can be worked out from the PC with the aid of a couple instructio
 ns.  This is in particular because at load time virtual addresses of all l
 oadable segments in an ELF PIC image are relocated by adding the same valu
 e (the base address in ELF-speak) to all of them\, according to how the im
 age has been mapped in virtual memory\, which is the difference between th
 e virtual addresses recorded in the file loaded and the corresponding actu
 al addresses in memory\, which in turn implies that the distance between t
 he text segment and any other segment remains fixed.\n\nThis approach does
  not work for NOMMU systems if we want to keep read-only text/rodata segme
 nts shared among processes\, because there is no virtual addressing availa
 ble to remap physical addresses such that for all the processes involved t
 he text and other read-only segments occupy the same addresses while the c
 orresponding read/write data segments are within a fixed distance from the
  text segment and do not clash with read/write data segments of another pr
 ocess both at a time.\n\nThe problem can be solved\, however it requires t
 hat read-only text/rodata segments and read/write data segments are mapped
  in memory independently of each other\, and that in turn precludes the us
 e of PC-relative addressing to reach data.  Instead a register has to be s
 et aside to hold the GP\, unique to each of all the ELF images/modules (bo
 th the main executable and all the DSOs) loaded.  This in turn not only re
 quires extending the RISC-V psABI with GP-relative addressing\, but defini
 ng a new convention for making function calls\, such that if a call reache
 s into another ELF module the value of the GP is updated accordingly.\n\nT
 his is handled by creating a data structure\, called a function descriptor
  (the first letters of which contribute to the FD letters in the FDPIC acr
 onym)\, that associates a value of the GP with each external (preemptible)
  function symbol.  The function descriptor is then used in the code sequen
 ce used to make a function call modified such as to load both the GP and t
 he PC with the addresses intended.  The use of a GP register\, the modifie
 d function calling convention\, and the new data structures and definition
 s all comprise the FDPIC psABI.\n\nIn this talk I am going to discuss a pr
 oposed design for the FDPIC psABI for RISC-V systems\, and the changes req
 uired for the toolchain and the runtime to support it with the Linux/GNU s
 ystem.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Brett Sheffield\nThe Internet is arguably the most us
 eful tool for enabling democracy that has ever been developed. It allows c
 itizens to communicate\, to organize and to disseminate information. It en
 ables whistleblowers and journalists to expose corruption and malpractice.
  It enables people to communicate across borders\, to share and discover e
 ach others cultures and beliefs\, to promote understanding and encourage p
 eace.\n\nUnfortunately the Internet is today threatened from all sides by 
 criminals\, governments and corporations alike. Unless we take steps to pr
 event it\, the weakening of this democratic tool will continue. Instead\, 
 we can choose to make it stronger and leave the next generation with a tru
 ly global\, rights-enabled communication network.\n\nThis talk will explor
 e the threats to our democratic lifeline from increased centralisation\, t
 racking\, censorship\, and harmful legislation\, and what we need to do ab
 out it.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Daniel Vetter\nAbout 10 years ago the first kernel mo
 desetting drivers landed in upstream\, with promise that this will usher i
 n a new era in GPU drivers: Multi-application rendering\, new compositors 
 and maybe even working suspend/resume support. Then years later it is time
  to take stock and see were we are.\n\nSpoiler: Things are really\, really
  good!\n\nCome and hear about the story of a community that grew massively
 : A subsystem with drivers spanning from the tiniest with less than a thou
 sand lines to the largest with over 2 million. About how to create some re
 ally good shader compilers. And everything in between. Plus a few attempts
  at explaining how this success was possible.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Gernot Heiser\nRISC-V has many attractions\, ranging 
 from the openness of the architecture\, its clean-slate design based on si
 mplicity and scalability\, as well as the RISC-V Foundation's strong commi
 tment to security from the ground up.\n\nAs such\, RISC-V is an extremely 
 attractive platform for the open-source seL4 microkernel with its unrivall
 ed verification and security story. This has led industry players\, especi
 ally Germany-based HENSOLDT Cyber\, making a major bet on the combination 
 of RISC-V and seL4\, resulting in them funding the formal verification (im
 plementation correctness proof) of seL4 on RISC-V.\n\nI will discuss our e
 xperience with implementing and verifying seL4 on the RISC-V architecture\
 , and related open-source technologies we are employing to allow us to bui
 ld secure systems. This includes the CAmkES component framework that suppo
 rts a security-by-architecture approach\, and the Cogent systems language 
 that is designed to reduce the cost of verified system components such as 
 file systems and device drivers. \n\nOne interesting aspect are timing cha
 nnels. We have been working for a number of years on *time protection*\, t
 he temporal equivalent of memory protection\, as a systematic timing-chann
 el prevention. Our experience on x86 and ARM processors is that they lack 
 the mechanisms to do this completely. RISC-V presents an opportunity to ge
 t this right\, and I will report on my experience working with the RISC-V 
 Foundation's Security Standing Committee to get the required mechanisms in
 to the processor specification.

  confusing\, boring\, and ever changing. In response\, we’ve developed w
 hat essentially are superstitious habits — theatrical\, security-flavour
 ed actions that we repeat in hopes of protecting ourselves from “the hac
 kers”.\n\nThere are two big problems here. First\, how do we effectively
  communicate relevant security advice to non-experts? And secondly\, is th
 at advice even persuasive enough to encourage real behavioural change? Wha
 t kind of advice should we be conveying\, and to whom?\n\nIn this talk we 
 cover why everyday people don’t follow security advice. To help us come 
 up with some solutions\, we introduce concepts from behavioural design\, p
 sychology and medicine. And I put the theory to the test by trialing some 
 unconventional ways of communicating security to the masses.

 catch. You don't own the server. It is deployed into a locked down proprie
 tary fortress where any old Bezos can gaze like the beady Eye of Sauron up
 on your users' data. Whats more the deployment process is completely opaqu
 e. You don't have access to any of the source. Horrifying!\n\nWell I'm her

 PaaS which we shan't mention\, I was lucky enough to find Piku. It was a d
 ream. No Kubernetes clusters or Docker swarms needed here. Just a thousand
  lines of Python and some shell scripts. You can grok the source in one ni
 ght. Point the bootstrap script at a fresh VPS (or Raspberry Pi!) and a co
 uple of minutes later you have your own multi-tenant app server for less t
 han the price of a single one of those dance-with-the-devil PaaS accounts.
  Configure a git remote\, write a couple of lines in your Procfile\, `git 
 push` and you're away! Your app unfolds upon your own server like an origa

 led\, SSL cert obtained\, Nginx configured\, all done for you.\n\nThis tal

 eird and wonderful/awful things that happen when dealing with the lowest l
 ayers of a modern Linux system and the things you need to consider when de
 signing a a low level build system. We shall also look at the outcomes of 
 these decisions and all the myriad of bizarre ways people want to build an

 he devil. Finally we shall try to estimate what the future shall hold for 
 building\, especially when it comes to cross-language cooperation and how 
 these\, and many other\, requirements make the life of a build system deve
 loper interesting.\n\nIncluding that one time we were told to rewrite Meso

  in Rustlang on Windows\, got frustrated at the performance of rustup (the
  installer for rust) and looked for bug. I found one which blamed a combin
 ation of NTFS\, small files and anti-virus software for the problem. This 
 wasn't an entirely satisfactory answer to my mind. Fast forward a bit\, an

 poor performance and the solution we put in place\, which has also helped

 evices are extremely expensive to develop due to the overhead of regulator

  devices to suit a specific individual. With traditional approaches this i
 s prohibitively expensive.\n\nOpen Source technologies including Arduino a

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Esther Payne\nIn 1996 Brian E. Carpenter of IAB and F
 red Baker of IETF wrote a co-statement on cryptographic technology and the
  internet.  This RFC wasn't a request for a technical standard\, it was a 
 statement on their concerns about Governments trying to restrict or interf
 ere with cryptography. They felt that there was a need to offer "All Inter
 net Users an adequate degree of privacy"\n\nSince that time successive gov
 ernments around the world have sought to build back doors into encrypted a
 pps and services to access more citizen and visitor data.  As of July 2019
 \, the AG of the United States William Barr stated: “Some argue that\, t
 o achieve at best a slight incremental improvement in security\, it is wor
 th imposing a massive cost on society in the form of degraded safety\,” 
 i.e For security Americans should accept weakened encryption.  The head of
  the FBI also claimed that weakened encryption wouldn't break it.  \n\nIn 
 Australia the metadata retention laws have been abused against journalists
  with 58 searches carried out by the AFP.  In 2015 ACT police carried out 
 115 metadata searches.  UK officials have a cavalier attitude to the EU SI
 S database which tracks undocumented migrants\, missing people\, stolen ca
 rs\, or suspected criminals.  \n\nIETF Session 105 mentioned privacy and c
 oncerns with the mass collection of data. While the IAB and IESG were worr
 ied about US export controls on cryptography there is an argument for RFC 
 1984 to be updated to include the unnecessary mass collection of data and 
 to use it as a term for IT professionals\, privacy advocates and the publi
 c to rally behind. \n\nIn this talk let's recount a brief history of gover
 nments around the world wanting to weaken encryption as RFC 1984 warned us
  about.  \n\nWe live in a time where citizens put data into commercial\, h
 ealthcare and Government systems to access services\, some services are on
 ly accessible online. From CCTV to Facebook people have little understandi
 ng of why mass collection of data is dangerous. There is little scrutiny o
 f who can access that data\, from Scotland to the US. \n\nOpen Surveillanc
 e is only a small part of the picture when profiling citizens.  It still c
 ounts as personal data\, when combined with metadata and the actual data t
 hat people put into social media and services like ancestor DNA test kits.
   Businesses who use CCTV have to put up signs to warn the public they are
  recording.  So called anonymized data still contains identifiers that can
  tie to individuals.  \n\nLet's talk about Ovid and peacocks. Let's explor
 e how to expand the RFC to cover recent developments in surveillance capit
 alism with governments accessing that data\, but not securing it. We need 
 to make it clear weakened encryption\, the mass collection and careless re
 tention of data isn't acceptable. We need to update and implement RFC 1984

 nverting a higher level language into machine code\, but with quantum comp
 uting the programs are written at a much lower level\, the equivalent of a
 ssembly code. However\, because of limitations with the current quantum co
 mputers available today even programs written at this low a level have to 
 be adapted and optimized for each specific backend to be able to run succe
 ssfully. Making this compilation processes effective and efficient directl

 cs of any operating system is the ability to safely store and retrieve end
  user data.  However\, this area can be one of the most difficult things t
 o test completely.  Hardware manufacturers strive to make their hardware a
 s reliable as possible\, so testing error paths for uncommon conditions is
  problematic.  For developers having a simple easy to use way to create th
 ese types of errors is vital for ensuring correctness.  Developers have to
 ols like scsi_debug\, dm-flakey\, and others to exercise these error paths
 \, but they all have limitations.\n\nVirtual machines are ubiquitous\, but
  people may not think of using them for purposely and deliberately creatin
 g errors for testing.  We have a opportunity to provide a test environment
  that allows easy testing of these infrequent error paths.  To force the k
 ernel down read error paths\, write error paths\, silent data corruption d
 etection/correction\, timeouts\, etc.\, during all times of kernel operati
 on and even before the kernel gets loaded by the boot loader.  It's the on
 ly way to present an error that is just like actual hardware.\n\nAttend th

 iculties in testing\n* Different approaches in generating storage errors\n

 s about how IoT can improve our lives.   \n\nThirty years after its public
 ation\, Donald Norman's seminal book "The Design of Everyday Things"\, whi
 ch examined how the tiny usability touches in everyday items matter so muc
 h\, remains relevant and important. In fact\, Don just last year wrote tha
 t the technology industry badly needs to re-focus on the true meaning of H
 uman Centered Design\, observing that despite his decades of advocacy\, th
 e same kinds of design flaws continually recur.\n\nWe are just a handful o
 f years short of the centenary of the publication of Modern Architecture p
 ioneer Le Corbusier's maxim "A house is a machine to live in"\, yet our ar
 chitecture remains stubbornly steam powered.\n\nMy position is that we oug
 ht step back and critically reexamine the shape and detail of our workplac
 es and homes. The great labour saving devices of the 20th century freed us
  from much physical drudgery\, but significant cognitive burden remains. I
  will examine\, in the abstract and concrete\, how much cognitive load is 
 imposed on us by our environment. It has been written that a modern human 
 makes 30\,000 choices every day.\n\nFor example\, why are our light switch
 es placed for the convenience of builders\, not inhabitants. Why do so man
 y of our labour-saving appliances require us to spend so much time monitor
 ing and pampering them. How often do you stumble about in the dark fumblin
 g for a light switch. Wouldn't you prefer to discover the failed refrigera
 tor or flooded storeroom before the contents are ruined?\n\nJoin me for an
  imagination of how Living In The Future could truly be better.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Alexander Krizhanovsky\nBack in 2013 we started devel
 opment of a Web Application Firewall (WAF) on top of one of the widespread
  HTTP accelerators. That time we realized that modern HTTP accelerators we
 re designed to service normal HTTP requests and don't suite well for filte
 ring massive HTTP traffic from malicious clients such as DDoS bots. A WAF 
 protecting huge web resources or thousands of small web sites also experie
 nces overloading due to deep analyzing of HTTP and web content.\n\nSo we s
 tarted to develop our own hybrid of HTTP accelerator and a firewall\, Temp
 esta FW\, to address the problem of servicing and filtering massive HTTPS 
 traffic. It can be used as standalone web acceleration and protection syst
 em as well as a WAF accelerator performing pre-filtering for more advanced
  WAF. Tempesta FW is an open source Linux kernel module integrated into th
 e Linux TCP/IP stack and implementing rich set of HTTP security features.\
 n\nTempesta FW implements HTTPtables\, HTTP requests filtering tool which 
 can be used together with nftables to define filtering rules on all networ
 k layers on the same time. Strict and flexible HTTP fields verification\, 
 HTTP cookies and JavaScript challenges\, as well as various rate limits\, 
 are also implemented to efficiently block HTTP(S) DDoS and Web attacks.\n\
 nThis talk describes common issues with filtering malicious HTTPS traffic 
 on modern HTTP accelerators\, how Tempesta FW solves them\, and several lo
 w-level topics such as  SIMD HTTP strings processing algorithms\, but most
 ly I'll concentrate on TempestaTLS - a fork of mbedTLS to implement TLS ha
 ndshakes in the Linux kernel. TempestaTLS cooperates with the TCP/IP stack
  to send records of optimal size and avoid copying. The handshakes state m
 achine is carefully optimized to provide highest performance. I'll show pe
 rformance benchmarks comparing TempestaTLS with OpenSSL in workloads close
  to real life DDoS attack against TLS handshakes.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Robert Foss\nOver the past years support for the diff
 erent Arm Mali series of GPUs has been crystalizing in the Open Source spa
 ce.\n\nThe first few steps towards supporting some Arm GPUs hardware were 
 taken in 2012\, and was aimed towards the low-end Mali 2/400 series of GPU
 s.\nWhile this work showed that it was indeed possible to create an Open S
 ource driver\, it would be a long time until the Lima driver actually mate
 rialized.\n\nVery much unlike the Open Source driver for the Mali 2/400 se
 ries of GPUs\, support for the Mali-T and Mali-G series started to be look
 ed at only in 2017. Since then development has progressed at a furious pac
 e. The mesa driver\, Panfrost\, has now been merged and provides initial s
 upport for the T700 and T800 series of GPUs based on the Midgard architect
 ure.\n\nIn this talk Robert will walk you through the process of creating 
 a driver for a new GPU\, from reverse engineering to upstreaming and then 
 finally shipping a new Open Source driver.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Ben Martin\nROS\, the "Robot Operating System" is mor
 e accurately described as a framework of open source software that runs on
  Linux and helps you build robots by combining larger "nodes" of code. ROS
  helps these nodes communicate and can handle (re)starting them\, monitori
 ng them\, and stopping them for you. With ROS you can use existing code to
  convert a depth sensing camera into fake laser scan data. Then you can in
 sert your own code to update a map showing where obstacles are located. Th
 is way you can focus on the parts of the robot that are the most interesti
 ng to you at the time and draw on a large base of existing code to enable 
 your robot to perform complicated tasks without having to write everything
 . Better yet you can drop parts of the code in and out of the robot to com
 pare how well an idea works against an existing implementation.\n\nI will 
 talk about ROS and about some of the robots I have built using it. There a
 re many lessons along the way\, some of which are only learnt the hard way
  it seems. It is always fun when your robot doesn't notice it is heading t
 oward a wall and you pick it up off the ground only to have it stop moving
  and think it is magically "outside the room" on it's internal map. The bo
 oks don't seem to cover the magical ghost_robot_mode=off option.\n\nInitia
 lly I attempted to run a low degree of freedom arm using MoveIt which is t
 he ROS arm control software. I ended up writing that code manually and fou
 nd that you need at least a 6 degree of freedom (dof) arm to succeed using
  MoveIt. While some cheap arm kits are sold as 6 dof they aren't and you w
 ill need some tinkering to make them real before MoveIt will yield accepta
 ble results https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfx0TrbOsok\n\nI hope that som
 e of the stories of long battles will inspire interest in using ROS and pl
 aying with robotics. I will have a few of my builds on hand including the 
 outdoors "houndbot" with discussions about physical builds.\nhttp://monkey

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Marissa Takahashi\nDigitization of society has result

 d natural sciences to more sensitive social aspects of human lives such as
  behaviour\, interaction and health.\n\nIt becomes increasingly urgent to 
 strike a balance between the benefits of big data research and the ethical
  implications on human subjects who generate those digital data. This talk
  will discuss the issues involved in building a trusted ethical data infra

SUMMARY:How to capture 100G Ethernet traffic at wire speed to local disk

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Christoph Lameter\nCapturing Ethernet data sounds sim
 ple. Who has not run tcpdump? But things are not that simple at 100G anymo
 re due to restrictions on performance of the disk subsystems and the Linux
  operating system overhead. And why would one want to capture 100G traffic
 ? One reason is that most of the fiber optic wide area links are being con
 verted from 10Gbps to 100Gbps circuits and another is that it is mandatory
  to capture all traffic going through links in some industries due to gove
 rnment regulation (well governments may want to capture traffic too for ot
 her reasons). And one does not want to build a large distributed file syst
 em or a large RAID array for that. What we want is a simple 1U Pizza box t
 hat can be deployed anywhere without too much fuss where 100G lines are de
 ployed.\n\nThis talk is going on a journey through the various hardware an
 d software considerations to get a box like that configured and talks abou
 t numerous hard lessons learned as to what works and what did not. On the 
 way we encounter numerous hardware and software limitations that seem to b
 e blocking the way and that required creative solutions.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Peter Hutterer\nSix or so years ago\, input devices i
 n userspace were handled by a set of different modules\, all with their ow
 n properties and behaviours. Where a device didn't work as expected\, it w
 as largely up to the users to find the right forum with examples that actu
 ally work. This had worked "well" for about a decade or two.\n\nThen\, lar
 gely driven by the promise of the differently-shaded pastures of Wayland\,
  a new library was born: libinput. The prime motivation behind this librar
 y was to have a  unified input stack that works well out of the box for an
 y device\, regardless of the display server. libinput is now the input bac
 kend for all major Wayland compositors and the default X.org input driver.
 \n\nThis talk goes through the motivations behind libinput and its design 
 choices. Why and how is it different to what we had before? Why can we han
 dle mice\, touchpads\, tablets\, touchscreens but not joysticks? Or the we
 ird but common question: Why are there no configuration options? (Spoiler 
 alert: there are quite a few.) The talk will explain how some of the devic
 es work\, how we handle them and  why certain behaviours are required and/
 or at last need to be worked around. I will explain the various current an
 d future features and our plans to improve them. And where we went wrong. 
 Because if it wasn't for the error part of "trial and error"\, everyone wo
 uld think that we know what we're doing.\n\nThis talk is about technical d
 etails\, but intended to be accessible to everyone. You won't need to know
  programming to understand it\, but you'll probably leave knowing more abo
 ut devices than you want to know.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Nathan Woodrow\nQGIS started back in 2002 as a simple
  hobby project with only a handful of developers and a small user base. Si
 nce then\, it has grown into one of the most popular cross-platform open s
 ource spatial desktop tools available\, with an ever-growing developer and
  user base\, widely used in many sectors\, even as a full replacement for 
 commercial offerings.  This growth has not come without cost or growing pa
 ins to the project and community.  A growing user base and an ongoing effo
 rt to be taken as a serious alternative to commercial offerings have led t
 o a shift in developer and user expectations for the project.  \n\nAs QGIS
  has grown into areas and user bases the early developers never dreamed of
 \, some of the feelings the project had have changed\, and this might have
  zapped some of the fun.  Was this inevitable\, as we pushed the project w
 ith more and more features and promotion in the spatial community?  How do
  you maintain the same feel for the project\, while at the same time becom
 ing more serious?\n\nWhat about the users and the community?  Have their e
 xpectations now changed for the project? At what point did we notice a cha
 nge in the community and the levels of service we were required to live up
  to?\n\nLong-term-release\, better build process\, better documentation\, 
 UI translations into many languages\; these all make great software\, but 
 at a cost for a mostly volunteer-run project. When does the project switch
  from pure volunteer to a more commercial entity?

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Anna Herlihy\nCompass\, the UI for MongoDB\, is an El
 ectron app that allows developers to visually develop aggregations and que
 ries for their database. Right now it accepts these queries in the MongoDB
  Shell syntax\, a JavaScript-based query language. However\, developers us
 e a wide range of programming languages in their apps\, and constant conte
 xt switching between languages can be painful. To cure this pain\, we want
 ed to allow users to export the queries they built in Compass into whateve
 r programming language they wanted. Even better\, we wanted to also allow 
 users to write their favorite language directly into Compass. To achieve t
 hese goals\, we needed a way to translate query syntax in any programming 
 language into query syntax in any other language\, so we needed to write a
  multi-language-input to multi-language-output transpiler in web-friendly 
 JavaScript!\n\nFurther\, since MongoDB has so many diverse and passionate 
 language communities\, I really wanted the transpiler to be “pluggable
 ” - community members should be able to add their favorite language to C
 ompass without needing to be compiler experts or know about what other lan
 guages were implemented. It is not enough to simply open source the code a
 nd hope people contribute. The compiler was architected with distributed c
 ollaboration in mind from the very start\, and this talk will describe all
  the steps we took to make the barrier to contribution as low as possible.
 \n\nThis talk will go through the technical design of the anything-to-anyt
 hing pluggable transpiler and teach attendees how they can add their own f
 avorite language to Compass. I’ll talk about classic compiler design pri
 nciples and how I leveraged various compiler technologies to create a dyna
 mic\, extensible transpiler. Lastly\, I’ll talk about how we can take th
 is transpiler and apply it to an abundance of other use cases!\n\nWho shou
 ld attend?\n\nAnyone with an interest in open source\, compilers\, parsers
 \, Compass\, MongoDB\, ANTLR\, or a general passion for complex technical 
 problems is welcome. I will talk about classic compiler design without req
 uiring attendees to be programming-language experts\, although any knowled
 ge of compiler implementations will be useful. Attendees will leave the ta
 lk knowing exactly how to extend Compass to support new languages and will
  hopefully be inspired to go out and add their favorite language to Compas
 s!\n\nWhy should they attend?\n\nThis talk addresses both MongoDB-specific
  challenges as well as highly technical computer science problems. Attende
 es will learn not only about Compass itself\, but about compiler design. A
 s developers we use compilers every day\, but it is not so often that we g
 et the opportunity to actually write them\, and compilers are awesome!

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: bunnie\nThe condensation of virtually everything into
  a single device -- the smartphone -- has normalized deviant behaviors tha
 t create security risks. For example\, many smartphone users conduct secur
 e transactions while juggling several other apps\, thus creating opportuni
 ties for adversaries to exploit human error. Furthermore\, running both se
 cure and insecure code on a common CPU increases the risk of exposing user
  secrets thanks to microarchitectural side channels --  a large\, complex\
 , and opaque attack surface.\n\nSystem architects have introduced "secure 
 enclaves" as a technique to minimize the attack surface between sensitive 
 secrets and an untrusted CPU. In theory\, secret key material never leaves
  the perimeter of the enclave – keys are generated and stored permanentl
 y within the enclave. Regardless of the implementation details\, secure en
 claves inevitably rely on an untrusted CPU to relay messages to the user. 
 This is because there is typically just one screen and keyboard presented 
 to the user\, and these elements are directly connected to the untrusted C
 PU. Thus\, secure enclaves can only protect keys from being compromised\; 
 they cannot protect the data itself from compromise. \n\nThis talk introdu
 ces Betrusted\, a device designed to partition a set of secure application
 s into a physically separate device that is designed using security-first 
 principles: the hardware is simple\, open source\, and is user-verifiable 
 from the keyboard to the LCD. Putting secure apps on a separate screen als
 o helps users focus on their secure transactions\, while minimizing attack
  surfaces and eliminating microarchitectural sidechannels. The Betrusted p
 roject’s scope will eventually range from secure silicon all the way to 
 application layer code\, and we are looking for developers of all stripes 
 who are interested in contributing to the project.

 problematic.\n\nTo help with this problem I have come up with a new open s

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Bonnie Wildie\nFinding aids are an important part of 
 archival practice\, designed and created to facilitate user access to arch
 ival collections. As these traditionally paper-based manifestations find e
 xpression in electronic formats\, institutions envision “new ways of loc
 ating\, interacting with and sharing information about archival material
 ”. In some cases\, institutions are proactively releasing finding aids\,
  such as indexes\, as open datasets. In others\, electronic index data is 
 being hacked\, liberated from behind institutional interfaces and set free
  as open data. This presentation takes the audience on a series of short d
 ata journeys provoked by hacked index data made free. It makes the argumen
 t for greater support for and release of open data by cultural heritage in
 stitutions. \n\nThese data-driven stories of discovery and exploration tak
 e us into the past\, and inspire us to ask new questions of these material
 s. Is there\, for example\, a link between occupation and location as evid
 enced by the visualisation of index data for the unemployed in Sydney\, 18

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Aleksa Sarai\nMost modern container image formats use
  tar-based linear archives to represent root filesystems\, which results i
 n many issues when using modern container images. In this talk\, we will d
 emonstrate a solution to this problem that we plan to propose for standard
 isation within the Open Container Initiative (code-named "OCIv2 images").\
 n\nThis talk is specific to the Open Container Initiative's image specific
 ation\, but the same techniques could be applied to other systems (though 
 we'd obviously recommend using OCI). \n\nIn order to avoid the [numerous i
 ssues with tar archives](https://www.cyphar.com/blog/post/20190121-ociv2-i
 mages-i-tar) it is necessary to come up with a different format. In additi
 on\, layer representations result in needless wasted space for storage of 
 files which are no longer relevant to running containers. Massive amounts 
 of duplication are also rampant within OCI images because tar archives are
  completely opaque to OCI's content-addressable store.\n\nLuckily the prob
 lem of representing a container root filesystem for distribution is very s
 imilar to existing problems within backup systems\, and we can take advant
 age of prior art such as [restic](https://restic.net/) to show us how we c
 an get significant space-savings and possibly efficiency savings.\n\nHowev
 er\, we also must ensure that the runtime cost of using this new system is
  equivalent to existing container images. Container images are efficient a
 t runtime because they map directly to how overlay filesystems represent c
 hange-sets as layers\, but with some tricks it is possible for us to obtai
 n most of the improvements we also gained in distribution with de-duplicat
 ion.\n\nOur proposed solution to all of these problems will be laid out\, 
 with opportunities for feedback and discussion.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Jamie Wilkinson\nTL\;DR: Configuration is code\, and 
 config changes should be treated with at least as much care\, skepticism\,
  and rigour as code changes are.  Config presents special challenges thoug
 h as it's usually not a fully operational Turing equivalent language\, but
  has a high "force multiplier" per character relative to code itself.  let
 's explore those challenges and how we can address them to reduce the risk
  of configuration-change-related outages. \n\nOver ten years ago Puppet La
 bs and others espoused the idea of "configuration as code\," setting a cou
 rse that crossed DevOps\, the APIfication of systems\, the Cloud\, and Ser
 verless.  Today\, you can write a few lines of config and invoke thousands
  of CPUs\, doing hundreds of operations\, deploying entire clusters of sys
 tems\, a huge force multiplier for IT operations.\n         \nThis force m
 ultiplier comes at a cost\, and that cost is risk and impact.  Never befor
 e has it been so easy to destroy an entire CDN in a single command. While 
 numbers vary\, studies show that a significant number of incidents in IT o
 perations are caused by configuration changes. \n\nConfiguration *is* code
  (and I'll prove it)\, but it sure lacks the same rigour that code receive
 s. Configuration formats like YAML and JSON do not have the same quality o
 f syntax checkers and debuggers that languages like C++\, Go\, and Ruby ha
 ve.  Often the first time you know that a configuration is semantically co
 rrect is when it is running in production.\n                              
                                                  \nSo what can we do about
  it?  Why does this presenter think that a comparison between configuratio
 n format and a debugger is even possible?\n\nIn this presentation we'll st
 art by looking at this problem from a theoretical point\, which will let u
 s look to other areas that solve a similar problem\, and then see how we c
 an apply that perspective back to configuration to make future production 
 changes safer than today.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Mike Cohen\nThis hands-on lab introduces delegates to
  Velociraptor: a new open-source (AGPL) platform to perform surgical foren
 sic evidence collection and incident response across a distributed compute
 r network. It’s fast\, precise\, powerful … and free.  It also support
 s Linux\, Windows and MacOS. Velociraptor is a unique tool since it offers
  a query language so that users may query their end point flexibly in resp
 onse to new threat information.\n\nParticipants will download the latest V
 elociraptor executable\, then configure and deploy a Velociraptor server a
 nd agent before collecting and examining evidence from across their person
 al test network. This workshop will focus on Linux. \n\nThe instructors wi
 ll walk through several real-life investigation scenarios\, including coll
 ecting evidence of program execution\, searching for evidence of lateral m
 ovement\, hunting for back doors and hunting for attacker IOCs. We also ex
 plore how Velociraptor can be used to perform continuous security monitori
 ng on the endpoints. Participants will become familiar with the main deplo
 yment options\, elements of the Velociraptor interface and the procedure f
 or configuring and executing basic hunts\, before moving to the powerful V
 elociraptor Query Language (VQL) which opens the doors to developing custo
 m hunts to meet specific investigation needs. We’ll also be covering man
 agement and monitoring features which ensure that Velociraptor can be used
  at scale\, with minimal impact on network performance.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Tim McNamara\nRust is often described as having a dif
 ficult learning curve. Let’s find a hidden escalator. By the end of this
  tutorial\, you’ll find building a command-line utility in Rust to be ab
 out as easy as one that’s written in Python or Ruby\, and you’ll be ab
 le to distribute it as a stand alone binary.\n\nMany of the difficulties l
 earning Rust emerge from two sources: jargon and novel concepts. Avoiding 
 the jargon keeps some the cognitive capacity in reserve to focus on the ne
 w concepts. Much of jargon has its roots in Rust’s functional programmin
 g heritage and early-adoption by programming language theorists. It’s po
 ssible to bypass much of that and focus on getting something working first
 . There’s plenty of time to learn about affine type systems and \nmonomo
 rphisation once you’ve got a working project or two.\n\nThis practical t
 utorial will take you through the process of writing a command-line from s
 cratch. We’ll learn all about the essentials of the language\, as well a
 s the tooling that’s available for people who may not have worked with a
  compiled language before. We’ll also spend some time talking about how 
  to access further help when you’re working on your own.\n\nAt this stag
 e of its life cycle\, everyone who knows Rust learned something else first
 . That means that there are plenty of people in your position who have bee
 n able to push through and make progress.\n\nCome and learn Rust!

 omplex solution geo-redundant.\n\nGeo-redundancy / mass data replication o
 ver long distances is now much easier to manage for sysadmins. Although sy
 stemd has some shortcomings and earns some criticism\, it can ease your au
 tomation of handover / failover when combined with the new unit-file templ
 ate generator from the long-distance data replication component MARS. It i
 s very flexible\, supporting arbitrary application stacks\, e.g. virtual m
 achines\, containers\, and much more.\nMARS is used by 1&1 IONOS for geo-r
 edundancy of thousands of LXC containers\, and on several petabytes of dat
 a\, with very low cost.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Ewen McNeill\nHistorically authentication was by user
 name and password\, perhaps with email as a password reset flow.   Users o
 ften wrote down their passwords (particularly older users)\, and possibly 
 they only had a few passwords and it was pretty easy to try all of them.\n
 \nModern times have proven that passwords\, particularly reused passwords\
 , are insufficient security for any slightly valuable account.  So lots of
  people are using password managers\, randomised passwords\, and 2FA (hard
 ware tokens\, TOTP\, etc).  Some accounts also require an additional authe
 ntication flow (email\, SMS) for "new device" logins.  "Security Aware" us
 ers are using randomised answers to security challenge questions\, perhaps
  also stored in their password managers.\n\nThis "security improvement" ha
 s a flip side: it's gone from being unlikely users will forget their passw
 ords or get locked out\, to being more likely users will lose access to th
 eir accounts through loss of 2FA or additional authentication paths (eg\, 
 phone number\, or email)\, and more likely that users will struggle with l
 ost password recovery.   And there's a darker side still: if the user is i
 ncapacitated\, or has passed away\, often someone else close to them will 
 need to act "on their behalf" with those accounts (for legitimate transact
 ions\, send out notifications\, or just to archive the account)\, and will
  likely struggle to gain access to them without the original users full se
 t of password manager / 2FA / etc.\n\nHow do we balance the need to improv
 e authentication security\, and reduce the simplicity of malicious account
  takeover\, with the need for there to be a way for legimate account use b
 y bereaved family members\, or other trusted associates?   There are no ea
 sy answers here\, but considering the questions is important.

 reate a "clubhouse" where fellow geeks could come together and form friend
 ships and connections through hacking together. Simple hey?\n\nWhat I didn
 't expect though was the massive outpouring of need for EDUCATION\, from a

  even Universities begging for free help with their projects and even just
  wanting us to build it for them. All this while we were still finding our
  feet and battling with membership fees\, making rent\, committee member c
 hurn  and all sorts of other local politics! Baby sitting and freeloading 
 strained us to breaking point!\n\nThis talk is the story of our space\, bu

  people learn in a way that helps them to help themselves and build good l
 earning and collaboration habits. I'll share some of the techniques we hav

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Bradley M. Kuhn\nPokerSource\, a now-defunct project\
 , was AGPL'd/GPL'd end-to-end online poker system that was deployed for pl
 ay-money games.  The server was written in Python and its most popular cli
 ent\, jPoker\, was written in pure Javascript using jQuery\, and was the v
 ery first deployed online poker system with a functioning pure Javascript 
 client.  The project had a long hobbyist lifespan\, dating back to the bas
 e C fast hand-evaluator library begun in the late 1980s.  During a brief p
 eriod in the late 2000s\, many developers were funded both full and part-t
 ime to work on the system\, and the system was deployed and widely used on
  a major Facebook-competitor site.\nThe history of the PokerSource project
  is an interesting case study to analyze how proprietary software technolo
 gies\, particularly for interactive online systems\, readily and handily b
 eat FOSS: even when FOSS was early to market and when the proprietariness 
 of the software actually directly hindered trust in the userbase.\nThis ta
 lk will tell the history of this project\, how a team of developers worked
  together to make a successful business out of of FOSS online poker.  The 
 talk will unabashedly analyze both the successes and failures of our effor
 t.  Attendees can learn what we did absolutely right in trying to build a 
 FOSS business ecosystem for poker\, and also the mistakes we also made alo
 ng the way that assured FOSS demise in the world of online poker.  Attende
 es can learn from the successes and mistakes to assure your FOSS project i
 sn't ultimately made obsolete by proprietary technology.

 e they become necessary after downtime.\nAs they say in aviation "experien
 ce is a cruel teacher: she gives you the test first\, and if you survive\,
  then you get to learn the lesson".\n\nExamples:\n- how to avoid spectacul
 ar lipo fires or circuit burns\n- when aviation goes wrong\, from AF447\, 
 QF32\, Boeings 737 Max\, and more\n- failures and avoiding failures in pro
 duction at Google\, including how automation can go wrong\n- why mkdir -p 
 0755 /path/to/dir can take you down hard\n- you know binary drivers suck\,
  but do you need more examples? If so\, come on by\n- why this temporary f
 ix will bite you hard soon after\n- a problem is not actually fixed until

 often resulting in breakouts or other severe attacks against the host syst

 ether there are more fundamental issues at play which could help resolve s
 ome of these problems. In this talk\, we will discuss what are possible pr
 oblem areas for container runtime security and our attempts to solve some 
 of these issues through both kernel-space and user-space protections -- an
 d how some of these protections may help many other programs outside the c
 ontainer runtime community secure themselves against attackers.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Elizabeth Alpert\nIn an increasingly digitised world\
 , societal understandings of the intersection between innovative technolog
 ies\, ethics\, and human rights have never been more critical. However\, d
 ifferent cultures and different sectors have differing understandings of a
 ll these things. A simple categorisation of human data as being either pub
 lic or private is insufficient to describe the complexities of a single hu
 man social group\, let alone the full complexity of human life and interac
 tion that is being recorded in more and more detail every day.\n\nIn Austr
 alia\, understanding the social impacts of this new regime of digital data
  is integral to facilitating economic\, social and health benefits\, witho
 ut further entrenching inequality for already vulnerable peoples within so
 ciety. Furthermore\, the application and impact of innovative technologies
  from all sectors including the tech industry is highly dependent on socia
 l acceptance\, which cannot avoid public debates around ethics\, human rig
 hts\, and responsible innovation.\n\nThere are currently many conversation
 s about the usage of human data and issues of privacy\, ethics\, and digit
 al human rights in government\, academia\, activist communities\, technolo
 gy in general\, and the information security and open data communities in 
 particular. Unfortunately\, most of these conversations are happening inde
 pendently of each other\, and as such are missing out on the knowledge\, e
 xperience\, and perspectives of other sectors.\n\nThis presentation is a d
 iscussion between an anthropologist (Dr Amelia Radke) specialising in digi
 tal human rights and a data infrastructure engineer (Betsy Alpert) on how 
 the notions of privacy\, security\, and ethics play out in our respective 
 fields. We argue that good data needs collaboration and deliberate design\
 , particularly in an our ever more data-centric world.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Fraser Tweedale\nFull disk encryption and\, more gene
 rally\, encryption of secrets at\nrest are essential tools in the security
  toolbox.  But deploying\nencryption at rest can have costs: latency (down
 time)\, repetition\n(productivity loss)\, proneness to error (typos\; "was
  that '1' or\n'l'?")\, challenges in supplying a passphrase when needed (e
 .g.\nheadless systems).  Automated decryption often relies on delivery of\
 nescrowed keys (a third party knows your secret).\n\nWe can do better.\n\n
 _Tang_ [1] is a protocol and (along with the client-side program\n_Clevis_
  [2]) software implementation of *network bound encryption*\;\nthat is\, a
 utomatic decryption of secrets when a client has access to\na particular s
 erver on a secure network.  It uses McCallum-Relyea\nexchange\, a two-part
 y key computation protocol based on Diffie-Hellman\nwhere only the client 
 can compute the key!  _Clevis_ [2] uses the\namazing *Shamir's Secret Shar
 ing* algorithm to implement unlock\npolicies with thresholds that can incl
 ude passphrases\, Tang servers\nand TPM-sealed secrets.\n\nIn this talk I 
 will outline the use cases\, explain the algorithms\nand demonstrate these
  tools.  The live demo will set up a machine to\nautomatically decrypt a L
 UKS volume when a required number of Tang\nservers are available.  I will 
 conclude with a discussion of\nlimitations\, assumptions and threats.\n\n[

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Dan Shearer\nFree software developers\, network engin
 eers and privacy advocates have been given a gift by the EU\, in the form 
 of six strongly-enforced laws based on human rights that have computer sci
 ence embedded in them. This talk covers:\n\n    • How human rights is di
 rectly linked to computer science via the legal text of these EU laws\n   
  • What new software solutions are required by these laws\n    • What 
 long-standing bad internet security practices are banned according to the 
 text of the law\n    • Examples of code based on long-standing open sour
 ce libraries that meet the requirements of the new EU laws \n\nOn the one 
 hand\, security habits until recently classified as  “best practice” a
 re now moved to “fix it  now or get off the internet”\, which is great
  news for those who have been advocating for better security for years. In
 frastructure providers are required to be secure. Security algorithms know
 n to be cracked may not be used. On the other hand\, the EU has introduced
  new concepts in software-mediated contracts between infrastructure suppli
 ers\, and a new emphasis on the privacy of the endpoints in end-to-end com
 munications. \n\nIn various ways\, these laws affect how personal data and
  communications are handled outside Europe including in Australia\, mandat
 ing better security and privacy. Which is just as well\, because these are
  dark days for individual privacy in Australia.\n\nIn January 2020 the Aus
 tralian Consumer Data Right bill is expected to become law\, providing pri
 vacy protection to any “reasonably identifiable person\, including a bus
 iness enterprise”\, which includes persons such as News Corp and BHP. At
  the same time the Data Sharing and Release Bill will be enacted\, which w
 ill remove more than “500 existing data secrecy and confidentiality prov
 isions across more than 175 different pieces of Australian Government legi
 slation”\, ensuring that companies such as News Corp and BHP have easier
  access to Australian citizens’ data. The Federal Court of Australia dec
 ided in 2017 that metadata is not personal data\, so no doubt the Data Sha
 ring and Release Act will indeed "streamline delivery of citizen data serv
 ices" from the Australian Government to private companies.\n\nSuccessive A
 ustralian prime ministers and their governments believe that “the laws o
 f mathematics are very commendable\, but the only law that applies in Aust
 ralia is the law of Australia.”   Not only do the laws of mathematics ap
 ply in Australia\, but Australian companies wanting to do business that in
 volves EU residents find themselves covered by EU laws\, and EU laws have 
 mathematics right at their core.\n\nInstead of (or as well as?) feeling de
 spair at the state of privacy in Australia\, the free software community c
 an argue that there is an economic benefit in adopting an EU rights-based 
 approach. Australian companies who deal with EU residents must comply with
  EU law. Maybe we can end up using the gold standard in privacy\, even in 
 Australia.

 \nculturally rhymes with "Big Oil"\, "Big Tobacco" and "Big Pharma".   If 
 we don't want the grim meathook future they are cooking up for us\, we nee
 d to visualise what we DO want  and fight harder to make it happen.\n\nSo 
 what does a privacy-perserving future look like?    How can we construct a
 n internet where the value of information accrues to individuals\, not to 
 billionaires?\n\nMany of the pieces are already in place.\n\n  * Emerging 
 data processing algorithms such as Private Set Intersection and Homomorphi
 c Encryption\n  * Personal data enclaves such as the Hub of All Things (HA
 T) (hubofallthings.com)\n  * Data exchanges like the Sam project (samnow.c

  "life") might look like when we wrest power back from Big Data.

 equire tests to be written in userspace running on a host kernel. You can 
 read more about KUnit in this LWN article[2].\n\nIn the first half of the 
 talk we will provide background on what unit testing is\, why we think it 
 is important for the Linux kernel\, how KUnit provides a viable unit testi

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Paul Haesler\nGeoscience Australia (GA) is the custod
 ian of a significant collection of national aerial photography\, curated b
 y GA and its predecessor agencies. The data extends over 70 years\, from t
 he 1920s through to the mid-1990s. This archive represents an important re
 source for understanding Australia’s changing landscape as the majority 
 of the collection predates high resolution satellite imagery.\n\nDigitisat
 ion of this archive is an ongoing priority as some of the original negativ
 es are now very old and starting to degrade\; but the approximately 280\,0
 00 images digitised so far are currently difficult to discover and access.
 \n\nSimilar but smaller archives of aerial photography are maintained by v
 arious state government agencies\, and some are quite mature in their adop
 tion of digital discovery and access\, however each agency has implemented
  their own system\, generally locked to a proprietary platform with little
  capacity for federating data across agencies.\n\nGA has therefore partner
 ed with Data-61 under the Platforms for Open Data (PfOD) program to design
  and build a canonical metadata repository for images in the collection\, 
 and an open API for discovering and eventually accessing these images.  Th
 e project has a strong focus on open source and standards based solutions\
 , with the hope that state government agencies will come on board\, facili
 tating federated discovery of imagery across state and federally managed a
 rchives.\n\nThe project is a fascinating example of old technology meeting
  new\, dealing with metadata sourced from nearly century-old hand-written 
 documents on the one hand\, and the latest cloud deployment technologies a
 nd emerging API standards for geospatial data discovery on the other.

 processing in a publicly accessible location and avoiding opening our home
  network.\n\nBut as we know\, the cloud is just someone else's computer\, 
 that we have to trust. If they are the arbiter of what happens in your hom
 e\, you are not truly in control.\n\nThis presentation discusses end-to-en

 smattering of zero-knowledge theory. You'll hear some of the available opt
 ions for resolving the connectivity issues and even taking some home-autom

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Brett Sheffield\nWritten in 2001\, RFC 3170 states: "
 IP Multicast will play a prominent role on the Internet in the coming year
 s.  It is a requirement\, not an option\, if the Internet is going to scal
 e.  Multicast allows application developers to add more functionality with
 out significantly impacting the network."\n\nNearly two decades later\, mu
 lticast is still largely ignored and misunderstood.\n\nThere are many comm
 on misconceptions about multicast\, including that it is only useful for s
 treaming video and audio.  It does so much more than that.\n\nMulticast is
  really about group communication.  It is\, by definition\, the most effic
 ient way to distribute data to groups of nodes.\n\nThis talk explains why 
 multicast is the missing piece in the decentralisation puzzle\, how multic
 ast can help the Internet continue to scale\, better protect our privacy\,
  solve IOT problems and make polar bears happier at the same time.\n\nMult
 icast brings with it a very different way of thinking about distributed sy
 stems\, and what is possible on the Internet.  From database replication t
 o chatops\, server federation\, configuration management and monitoring.\n
 \nEven applications\, such as chat\, which are fundamentally multicast in 
 nature are being built on top of unicast protocols.  There is a Better Way
 .\n\nMulticast lets us do things that would be impossible with unicast.  I
 magine sending software updates to a billion IOT nodes simultaeneously\, u
 sing just one tiny virtual server.\n\nAt a time when even the web is movin
 g to UDP with HTTP/3 and WebRTC\, it is time we took a serious look at wha
 t we're missing by not using multicast at the network layer to underpin ou
 r Internet protocols.\n\nWe'll discuss how you can start using multicast i
 n your project today\, and how multicast design and thinking differs from 
 unicast.  We'll cover some of the different types of IP multicast\, the ba
 sics of multicast routing and how to build in TCP-like reliability.\n\nWe'
 ll explore what can be done with multicast now\, and look forward to how i
 mprovements in multicast can make a better Internet for the future.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Yaakov\nWhen proving somebody’s identity\, it’s u
 sually an important matter and critical to get right. With digital licence
 s springing up around the globe\, including here in Australia\, how can we
  be sure that the computer is telling the truth? Does digitising the proce
 ss actually improve it?\n\nIn 2015\, the NSW Government announced a commit
 ment to providing digital licences so that people can identify themselves 
 using their smartphones. After a limited trial in 2018 and 2019\, the syst
 em is supposed to go live to users across the state some time soon. Other 
 countries are trialling similar systems\, and South Australia already has 
 one.\n\nThe way this is presented it is largely as a black box\, where ˚
 ✧₊⁎ magic happens ⁎⁺˳✧༚ and your identity is somehow proven
 . For many people\, particularly tech-savvy folk\, magic is not a sufficie
 nt explanation\, nor a basis for trust.\n\nUsing the NSW digital licence s
 ystem and associated app\, this talk will:\n\n- have a look at authenticat
 ion\, authorisation and identity in the physical realm\n- investigate diff
 erences between real-world identity and digital identities\n- explore the 
 inner workings of the New South Wales digital driver’s licence system\, 
 based upon reverse-engineering\n- discuss why you should - or shouldn’t 
 - trust digital licensing systems\, and how it impacts identity verificati
 on in your own lives

 ar as an indication to emacs to send a control key event (xkcd 1172).\n\nB
 ut the universe hasn't provided us an army of people to test the devices\,
  an infinite amount of resources and a lot of time to spare. So making tru
 e CI on actual physical devices is hard. That's a pity\, really. Luckily\,
  we have computers\, and that's a start.\n\nIn this talk we will show how 
 we moved from basically no regression tests 10 years ago to a state where 
 now every commit gets tested against a good amount of various devices. We 
 will show how we can do CI on the kernel side\, and how we can do CI on th
 e user space side.

 widely available for the Kubernetes ecosystem\, but fabulous visual develo
 per environments are coming along more slowly\, hindering uptake among app
 lication developers who are new to container orchestration or who prefer v
 isually rich development environments.\n\nThis session will introduce the 
 free Kubernetes extension for the open-source Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
  editor\, and show you core features that simplify and speed up the Kubern
 etes developer experience.  I’ll also show how you add to the behaviors 
 and views in the VS Code k8s extension and show some extensions built on i
 t\, each illustrating a different way to make Kubernetes application devel

 x kernel are self contained and reasonably small. Review usually involves 
 a few interested developers and the relevant maintainer. Making a large in
 frastructure change is another matter. It can involve multiple sub-systems
  and a score of maintainers\, all with their own development priorities. C
 asey Schaufler has spent the past seven years reworking the Linux security
  modules infrastructure. In this talk he shares his experience dealing wit
 h the long development process\, unresponsive or hostile maintainers\, and
  surrounding technologies that change without warning. He offers recommend

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Peter Burnett\nMoodle is an open source learning mana
 gement system\, popular with universities. As Moodle has aged\, some aspec
 ts of its security have fallen well behind industry standards for security
 . This talk will discuss the measures that have been taken to bring it up 
 to scratch\, and the ways that this can be applied to any application. The
  first priority in improving the security of the platform was targeting it
 s password policy\, which suffers from the older model of 'You must have a
 tleast 2 uppercase characters'. To address this\, a new plugin was develop
 ed for the platform\, which acts much more in line with current NIST guide
 lines\, including checks for compromised passwords using the HaveIBeenPwne
 d API\, and a user's personal information. This talk will show the guideli
 nes we worked against\, and how it can be applied to any applications pass
 word flow.\n\nThe next challenge to tackle was the lack of ways to augment
  an authentication flow. There are a huge amount of ways to authenticate t
 o a Moodle\, with support for all major SSO services\, however\, no potent
 ial to augment this process with additional tools such as MFA. To this end
 \, work was done with Moodle HQ to implement a platform for this functiona
 lity on all pages that require higher security\, such as changing and rese
 tting a user's password. This talk will discuss what we learned along the 
 way\, and how to avoid common problems when implementing an MFA system suc
 h as security questions.\n\nFinally\, this talk will discuss the work that
  we are doing to implement MFA in a way that works alongside other authent
 ication methods\, such as SSO\, with discussion on alternative factors\, s
 uch as trusted IP networks.

 tant\, but oftentimes it's seen as either something to be done before a pr

 is complete -- at which point it's easily forgotten.  This problem is espe
 cially difficult with hardware projects\, which can be extremely obscure a
 nd dense.\n\nProfessional chips generally come with a reference manual tha
 t describes the hardware.  This manual is usually created by a dedicated s
 taff that uses publishing tools and spreadsheets to create a final PDF fil
 e.  As small open source developers we rarely have the resources to create
  these reference manuals by hand.\n\nThis talk will cover `lxsocdoc`\, and
  cover how we document the various peripherals inside projects such as Fom
 u and Betrusted\, and provide motivation for treating documentation like c
 ode.  We'll show why documenting as you go is both beneficial to your end 
 users\, as well as beneficial to yourself\, and why an approach such as th
 e one we take in `lxsocdoc` can help yourself today\, not to mention your 
 future self.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Kees Cook\nLike all C/C++ programs\, the Linux Kernel
  regularly suffers from memory corruption flaws. A common way for attacker
 s to gain execution control is to target function pointers that were saved
  to memory. Control Flow Integrity (CFI) seeks to sanity-check these point
 ers and eliminate a huge portion of attack surface. It's possible to do th
 is today with the Linux kernel (or any program) with Clang/LLVM's CFI impl
 ementation.\n\nThis presentation will discuss how Android is using Clang's
  CFI in the Linux kernel for recent phones\, how it is being upstreamed\, 
 and what you can do to use CFI yourself. We will explore what Clang actual
 ly inserts for code\, data\, and symbols to protect indirect calls\, what 
 needed fixing in the kernel to support it\, and what's still missing. We'l
 l wrap up with a short demo of CFI foiling a kernel attack.

  to obtain access to such a system? You guessed it:\n\n"Dave\, can you bui
 ld a timing system for us?"\n\nIn this talk I'll walk through the challeng
 es of designing and building a millisecond accurate timing system using op
 en source sfotware and tools that has timing points far enough away that r
 unning cables is not practical\, is in terrain that makes radio comms larg
 ely impossible\, has to be set up on site in less than 60 minutes by one p
 erson and include safety systems integrated into race control protocols.\n
 \nThis timing system involves Beaglebones\, designing and building custom 
 hardware capes and the software to interface with them\, as well as all th
 e software to control the system and handle all the timing logic and safet
 y procedure interlocks. It involves python\, C\, MQTT\, wide area networki
 ng\, highly accurate distributed time synchronisation and\, of course\,  f
 ast cars.

SUMMARY:Open Source Won\, but Software Freedom Hasn't Yet: A Guide & Commi

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Bradley M. Kuhn\nHistory never unfolds as we would ex
 pect.  It's surprising and jarring that we've achieved both so much and so
  little.  Every day\, there is more Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) i
 n the world than ever in history\, but it's also a little bit harder each 
 day to live a life that avoids proprietary software.  Today's world of sof
 tware technology is a ridiculous paradox. \n\nMost software that we depend
  on every day is under someone's else control.  Whether it's the cloud ser
 vice run by a big company\, the medical devices that keep us alive\, or th
 e Javascript application for everything from our banking to our social med
 ia\, the code that handles our most sensitive data and life-essential comp
 uting tasks is usually proprietary.  Even Linux-based devices\, which are 
 ubiquitous\, rarely comply with the GPL and therefore are more-or-less alm
 ost as proprietary as any other device.  Linux is everywhere\, yet early F
 OSS adopters have never had less software freedom than we do today.\n\nOnc
 e upon a time\, it was viable for someone living in the industrialized wor
 ld to function in daily society in pure software freedom.  In those days\,
  being a software freedom activist was akin to being a vegan or vegetarian
 : activists could (relatively conveniently) live a lifestyle that reflecte
 d our values and proved our sociopolitical point in mundane\, daily terms.
 \n\nLeading by example is not so easy anymore.  The strongest supporters o
 f software freedom among us\, if they chose to remain living in the indust
 rialized world\, make compromises.  Our political opponents  tell us that 
 our cause is misguided since these compromises "aren't so bad".  Meanwhile
 \, our would-be political allies question our commitment to the cause beca
 use we carry devices with some proprietary firmwares.  Navigating this com
 plex climate may well be the hardest challenge we face.\n\nCooptation is c
 ommonplace for social justice movements\, and the cooption process can be 
 ongoing for decades.  The software freedom movement is a few years into th
 is cooption: this is precisely why we see major leaders stand up and shout
  "Open Source is the default\; Open Source has won!" while presenting slid
 es from a Macbook.  The most difficult days don't lie behind us\; they lie
  ahead.\n\nThis talk is about surviving the personal struggle of software 
 freedom activism in this current climate.  Many of us want a world with on
 ly FOSS and no proprietary software\, but it's unlikely we'll liberate our
 selves from proprietary software in our lifetimes.  How do we live our liv
 es to maximal effect to carry forward the torch of software freedom both i
 n this generation and onto the next?  How do we weather the inevitable fai
 lures and seemingly insurmountable challenges as we watch what was once FO
 SS slowly become proprietary again\, or see new technologies exist only as
  proprietary\, or\, even worse\, exist as a warped version of FOSS that "s
 eems open" but fails to give most software freedoms to most users?  Let's 
 learn and explore together how to survive as activists now that the going 
 got tough.

 ring wizardry that went into building these great machines. In this talk\,
  Josh takes a look at the hardware engineering behind one of his favourite
  games of the 1980s\, and shows you how to build an emulator to preserve a

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Tishampati Dhar\nThis talk describes the WhatsApp cha
 t protocol and various endpoints where data can be unlocked from this clas
 sically end-to-end encrypted channel. Unlocking and automating the WhatsAp
 p channel is a pre-requisite for scaling businesses in the 3rd world where
  this is a dominant communication medium. In the third-world and from my p
 ersonal experience in Kenya a lot of businesses run on the command-line\, 
 the command-line being the WhatsApp message text entry box. This talk desc
 ribes means of putting shell processor behind that command line to parse n
 atural language\, emoji and semi-structured data to capture issues from th
 e field (stderr)\, information from the field (stdout) and to forward pars
 ed data to order management\, tickets and other systems (pipe\,redirect).\
 n\nWe will cover initial unofficial attempts including:\n-  Direct HTTP pr
 otocol unlocking \n-  Using Headless browsers such as PhantomJS/Puppeteer 
 with WhatsApp for Web\n-  Using Android Notifications API to forward messa
 ges to another app\n-  Using rooted Android phones to uncrack the encrypte
 d db and forward content\n-  You can't stop the screenshot\n\nRecently the
 re are more official channels for general purpose automation and CRM / Sup
 port Chat integrations via\n- Twilio\n- FreshChat\n- Zendesk\n- Others as 
 WhatsApp graciously grants access\n\nWe have firsthand experience with the
  Twilio Whatsapp API / Python SDK which should be familiar to anyone havin
 g using Twilio API before. This is layered with text comprehension advance
 s from modern Neural Network based approaches to create effective automate
 d customer service \, order creation and field data capture solutions.\n\n
 A lot of Python web development has focused on building API's  ( stateless
 )\, User-interfaces targeting the browser etc. however Chat as UI requires
  a stateful backend which has memory and uses context effectively to craft
  responses. These bots are often domain specific and little attempt is mad
 e to be Turing-passing as opposed to being functional with semi-structured
  input.\n\nSemi-structured input can be flexibly parsed using mostly rule 
 based NLP\, deep learning based NLP is the flavour of the day and only bec
 omes necessary for processing client input (from users outside the organiz
 ation who cannot be effectively change managed). Tools in the classic pyth
 on NLTK library for processing WhatsApp data include:\n- Stemmers\n- Token
 izers\n- Fuzzy Matchers\n- Regular expressions ( for deterministically nam
 ed entities such as truck registration\, containers numbers\, vessel names
  etc.)\n\nWhen push comes to shove\, the data can be piped via one of the 
 cloud NLP platforms as well. Overall the humans in the WhatsApp treadmill 
 can be assisted by machines to systematize the flood of words.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Simon Lees\nPretty much everything that has ever been
  designed is some form of balance between form and function\, from modifie
 d car's to architecture to clothes and even user interfaces. In the modern
  age of material design\, Visual Design Group's and Human Interface Guidel
 ines this balance has very much shifted to be in favor of function over fo
 rm\, an interface that looks good is still important but looks always seem
  to play a distant second to usability. \n\nThe purpose of this talk is to
  explore what happens when you flip that idea and rather then focusing on 
 creating user interfaces that are primarily usable instead focus on creati
 ng user interfaces that are works of art with a lesser regard as to how ea
 sy they are to use.\n\nFortunately this idea is nothing new\, in the late 
 90's Raster founded the enlightenment desktop inspired by the artistic use
 r interfaces of the games he played growing up\, he brought these concepts
  to the desktop.\n\nThe advancement of graphics hardware in the mid two th
 ousands lead us to the world of fish tanks inside cubes\, wobbly windows a
 nd painting fire on the screen. Not because there was any real need or use
  but because someone could. Sadly since then the world of the Linux deskto
 p has tried to go all professional and many of the fun interesting things 
 have been lost.\n\nIn the last year or so I have been working on reviving 
 some of these old themes for Enlightenment with a hope to get people creat
 ive about UI development again for fun. As well as showing off some of the
  things above from the past this talk will discuss how you can go about ma
 naging changes in large numbers of themes for new versions through using v
 ersion control and scripting to automatically change the color of icons et
 c.\n\nOver the years I have done some theming for various different Linux 
 desktops and I will also spend some time covering what is and isn't possib
 le in various desktops.

  be usable by many\ndevelopers working on both ARM and Risc-V projects. Fi

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Gaurav Nelson\nDealing with Git often becomes problem
 atic for us writers. Although some writers excel at handling Git commands 
 and its nuances\, many writers struggle to deal with them. In this present
 ation\, I am sharing some techniques I have seen people (developers and wr
 iters) use.  These tricks are easy to use\, and writers can quickly adapt 
 them to their writing workflow. This presentation isn't about learning git
  basics or understanding git commands\, but rather\, using aliases and bas
 h functions to handle typical Git workflow commands we use daily.\n\nUsing
  aliases and bash functions\, allow you to map easy English terms for the 
 Git commands you use every day. For example\, to create a new branch\, you
  can run the command `git newbranch <branch-name>` instead of `git checkou
 t -b <branch-name>`. Which is more logical and saves you from remembering 
 the actual command. This example is a simple operation\, you can also use 
 these techniques handle complex tasks\, such as downloading someone else's
  pull request (or merge request) for review.

 d then ESP32 as the host processor. The firmware has evolved from Arduino 
 Wiring/C++ to Micropython. My recent efforts have been focused on transiti
 oning a to full-linux capable host processor while delegating the real-tim

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Claire Reeler\nEducation is a vital component of huma
 n society. Our young are born relatively underdeveloped compared to many o
 ther species. We sacrificed a longer development in utero for larger brain
  size. Thus we are born needing to learn and geared to learn as fast and e
 fficiently as possible\, even adapting our brain architecture to suit the 
 material we learn\, and sadly\, discarding areas that are not developed. D
 uring the long millennia of human (pre)history\, we have adapted how we ed
 ucate each other. This presentation will whip through the last 100\,000 ye
 ars with a very brief overview of how education has changed and what we ha
 ve learned about the process on the way. The 'open' context of human socie
 ties through time in the context of education is also examined\, with a go
 al of distilling information that has application in our modern lives and 
 our approach to open education in the current sense.\nWe will examine what
  'education' means in different human societies and through time\; and the
  implications of an 'open' approach and how that fits with different ways 
 of organising society. What has worked well\, how can we define and measur
 e that\, and how we can apply it in our modern world\, which is so very di
 fferent to anything that has gone before are all topics to be addressed. W
 e will also touch on the aspects of human psychology that are influenced b
 y our evolutionary biology and what that means for how we teach and learn\
 , as well as how we can work most effectively. The separation of 'work' an
 d 'education' is a very modern phenomenon and one that some of our ancesto
 rs might find hard to comprehend. Thus\, looking at education through time
  can teach us a lot about how humans can optimise living in all spheres of
  their lives.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: David Tulloh\nThis tutorial will take you through the
  process of designing a circuit and PCB using Kicad. \n\nWe will design a 
 watering system relay controller\, with wireless communication and solar p
 ower. From block diagram\, to circuit\, to PCB.\n\nThis will be a guided j
 ourney\, a Disney on rail adventure where the story\, components and desig
 n have been prechosen for a cultivated\, time controlled\, experience. The
  focus will be on the use of the tools\, eeschema to design the circuit an
 d pcbnew to layout the PCB.\n\nYou will be shown each technique then given
  time to practice it by finishing off the other elements while I circulate
  to assist. Awkward silences will be filled by discussions of the design d
 ecisions that have been taken\, amusing anecdotes and opinionated advice o
 n what consists of good design. Checkpoints with preprepared files for cat
 chup will be provided in case you struggle in any particular area\n\nPleas
 e ensure that you have Kicad 5 installed and have tested that it runs\, we
  will not have time during the session to fix faulty installs. You will al
 so need an internet connection to be able to download preprepared files an
 d pdf datasheets.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Sreejith Anujan\nBreaking down a monolithic applicati
 on into atomic services offers various benefits\, including better agility
 \, better scalability and better ability to reuse services.  However\, mic
 roservices also have particular security needs - \n\nTraffic encryption to
  defend against man-in-the-middle attack.\nFine grained access control and
  mutual TLS.\nAuditing tools to identity who did what at what time!\n\nIst
 io addresses the security challenges developers and operators face in a di
 stributed microservice architecture. Istio provides strong identity\, powe
 rful policy\, transparent TLS encryption\, and authentication\, authorizat
 ion and audit (AAA) tools to protect your microservices and data. \n\nIn t
 his hands on tutorial session\, attendees will \n1) Understand the high le
 vel architecture of Istio \n2) Custom policy enforcement to  limit traffic
  to a service\n3) Service Traffic encryption using Mutual TLS\n\nTakeaway:
  Learn how  Istio enforces security features to mitigate insider and exter
 nal threats against  your data\, endpoints\, communication and platform \,
  wherever you run your microservices.\n\nPre-requisites: \nIntermediate un
 derstanding of container technology and microservices architecture. BYOD w
 ith a modern browser and an internet connection to access cloud based labs

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Mike Bailey\nIf you use Amazon AWS and prefer the com
 mand line over ClickOps(TM)\, this talk might just make your week.\n\nFor 
 decades\, the command line and shell scripts have been a core part of unix
  culture and preferred tools for many sysadmins. The existing unix command
 s that come with any linux/bsd distro\, along with streams/pipelining\, pl
 ain text and a lack of mouseclicks are just a few of the attractions.\n\nI
 n recent years\, ClickOps seems to be on the rise - largely due to enterpr
 ise web applications with suboptimal (or absent) CLI tools.  Many of us ha
 ve been spending more time in the AWS Web Console than we would like for t
 his very reason.\n\nBash-my-AWS is a simple but extremely powerful set of 
 CLI commands for managing resources on Amazon Web Services. They harness t
 he power of Amazon's AWSCLI\, while abstracting away the verbosity. The pr
 oject implements some innovative patterns but (arguably) remains simple\, 
 beautiful\, readable and easily extensible.\n\nBy emitting line oriented o
 utput instead of JSON\, Bash-my-AWS commands work well  in pipelines with 
 other standard unix commands. Additionally\, the commands take a novel app
 roach to handing STDIN that  greatly improves the user experience.\n\nThe 
 talk will introduce the project and describe it's novel use of pipelining 
 to improve the user experience.\n\nWebsite: https://bash-my-aws.org\nGit:

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: James\nSometimes evil conglomerates\, large companies
  and/or totally regular and normal individuals prefer to run Kubernetes th
 emselves\, instead of using a public cloud provider - perhaps they don't t
 rust the InterGoogles\, perhaps they want to experience the incessant joys
  of maintenance and upgrades themselves\, or perhaps (THE REAL REASON) the
 y wanted to justify their sweet\, sweet devops stickers on their laptop.\n
 \nSure\, not trusting someone else's computer make sense in some threat mo
 dels\, the (sometimes overly-enthusiastic) DIY approach does mean they ope
 n themselves up to a whole host of other problems - Google probably does k
 now how to deploy\, manage and secure Kubernetes better than anyone else\,
  since they kinda built it. They've probably even got better stickers.\n\n
 Unfortunately\, setting it up is HARD. There's so many moving parts and th
 e vaguely dodgy how-to posts on random blogs always seem to be a few versi
 ons behind - AND they feel like they get away with it by saying “Definit
 ely probably don't do this in production\, but it's totally fine to do for
  testing\, what's the worst that could happen?*"\n\nThis talk will take yo
 u through some of the parts of the Kubernetes setup that are commonly igno
 red (“oh yeah we’ll definitely $100% get to that later”)\, or exclud
 ed from scripts you piped from curl to bash\, or are pretty easy to accide
 ntally get wrong if you didn’t know about this other thing that wasn’t
  made immediately obvious. If you’re a security auditor\, these are your
  critical severity tickets. If you’re an admin\, these are the things th
 at differentiate your totally awesome cluster of orchestrated hotness from
  a totally awesome cluster of orchestrated hot mess. And if you’re an at
 tacker who’s popped a shell and found themselves trapped in a container

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Hugh Blemings\nOpen hardware for embedded and general
  purpose applications with low to medium compute performance requirements 
 has become almost commonplace\, a response to a growing understanding of t
 he need for solutions that embrace libré principles.\n\nOpen hardware for
  server class/high performance computing requirements is a relatively new 
 concept but is\, appropriately\, becoming an area of focus for data centre
 s\, supercomputers\, and security conscious workstation/end users alike. C
 ontributors to the OpenPOWER project have been working together to create 
 an open ecosystem based around the POWER Instruction Set Architecture that
  enables truly open -and- high performance compute solutions. \n\nThe resu
 ltant systems extend from high performance embedded systems\, desktop work
 stations up to the worlds fastest supercomputers and have an entirely open
  software stack - firmware to remote management to hypervisor to OS to app
 lications.  Many of the systems have hardware that is likewise entirely op
 en source at the schematic\, PCB and\, increasingly component level.\n\nPu
 t colloquially: OpenPOWER systems are the only commodity high performance 
 systems out there that don’t have any funny hidden management engines\, 
 or binary blobs of executable code in their firmware.  Some even ship with
  a recovery DVD that in addition to the full source code for everything ru
 nning on the machine\, include the schematics and other technical drawings
  too.\n\nThis session will explain the importance of open hardware and sof
 tware at all levels of the compute environment - embedded/IoT to desktop t
 o hyperscale systems. From here a brief introduction to OpenPOWER and the 
 OpenPOWER Foundation as well as an update on the ecosystem\, the status of
  the hardware and software stacks in question as well as an overview of so

SUMMARY:Linux in the Cloud\, on Prem\, or... on a Mainframe?

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Elizabeth K. Joseph\nDiscussions around where to host
  your Linux-based infrastructure tend to center around whether you should 
 use the cloud or your own on-premises hardware. Architectures beyond x86 a
 re rarely discussed. This talk will give you a glimpse into the modern mai
 nframe running Linux\, and why it and other alternative architectures like
  ARM and POWER should be considered.\n \nWe’ll first look at the birth o
 f time-sharing and the first Virtual Machine (VM) technology that surfaced
  on the mainframe in the 1970s\, driven by community-based efforts and wit
 h help from one of the oldest computer organizations in the world. From th
 ere\, we’ll have a look at how VM technology allowed Linux to be run on 
 the mainframe by a group of hobbyists in the late 1990s\, and then was swi
 ftly noticed by IBM and development continued for the polished product we 
 see today.\n \nToday\, there is an entire product line of mainframes that 
 exclusively run Linux (RHEL\, SLES\, or Ubuntu) rather than the data-focus
 ed\, batch-processing operating systems they are best known for. For the s
 ecurity-conscious\, encryption technology built into the processor and on 
 additional PCIe cryptography cards is accessible in Linux\, allowing for e
 nd-to-end encryption of data at rest and in flight that doesn’t burn all
  of your regular processing resources. Enterprise-grade hardware that also
  has built-in redundancy reduces the need for management of a fleet of x86
  servers\, and the entry level mainframes today even fit into a 19” rack
  space in the datacenter. There are even a few services in the cloud run b
 y IBM that transparently to the user use a mainframe in the back end.\n\nL
 ooking at the future\, with policies and laws making data protection even 
 more important\, there will be an increasing need for systems that have ha
 rdware-driven encryption technologies built in. Power consumption from the
 se increasing needs will also continue as the rate of on-demand data proce
 ssing and storage continues to soar. As a result\, we'll likely see altern
 ative architectures that put power savings become increasingly compelling.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Arun Raghavan\nWhile PulseAudio has been a standard c
 omponent in desktop and embedded Linux for a decade now\, it was always wr
 itten with uncompressed audio data in mind.\n\nTo save power. modern SoCs 
 often support "compress offload"\, where an efficient DSP can receive comp
 ressed MP3/AAC/... data\, decode and render it to be played out.\n\nIn thi
 s talk\, I'll describe how this was implemented in PulseAudio\, what chall
 enges and tradeoffs were involved\, and what the future might hold for thi
 s work.

 and deploying technical documentation for a mature codebase in minimal tim
 e. It details practical advice and lessons learned from the speaker's pers
 onal experience taking the HarfBuzz library from a starting point with vir
 tually no documentation to a full-fledged set of internal and external ref
 erences\, plus code-integration and end-user guides.\n\nThe topics covered
  will include designing documentation from the top down as an "alternative
  API" to the code itself\, strategies for staging a large documentation pr
 oject is discrete parts that can be deployed successively\, building docum
 entation in a continuous-integration environment\, and practical tips for 
 documentation teams.\n\nThe presentation will also showcase the benefits o
 f rolling out documentation in parallel to development\, including insight
 s on system architecture and improved community involvement.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Matthew Wilcox\nSince 2002\, Linux has used huge page
 s to improve CPU performance.  Originally\, huge pages supported 2MB pages
  on x86.  They evolved to support other architectures and\, eventually\, 1
 GB pages on x86.  Despite this relative success\, the huge page mechanism 
 is not flexible enough to support related hardware features.  One desirabl
 e feature is a "medium" large page size (e.g.\, ARM CPUs support a 64kB pa
 ge size).  Another is a larger page size (e.g.\, some network devices supp
 ort pages as large as 2GB).\n\nIn this talk\, I will argue that using larg
 er pages to reduce software overhead is as important as enabling hardware 
 optimisations.  I'll talk about the recent patches to improve the performa
 nce of larger pages in the page cache.  I'll also talk about patches to br
 ing support for larger pages to normal filesystems.  And I'll talk about s
 ome of the downsides of using larger pages\, and some of the future limita
 tions of using larger pages.\n\nThis talk is for kernel developers and tho
 se who are interested in learning more about how some hardware works.  Sin
 ce these optimisations are supposed to be transparent to user space\, no c
 hanges should be needed to userspace code to take advantage of them.  End 
 users should only notice their web browsers running faster\, their databas
 e queries completing faster and their birds being slightly less angry.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Anne Jessel\nMany people know that Facebook and other
  companies track what we do online. Cookies and JavaScript are complicit i
 n allowing Facebook and others to know what we like and who our friends ar
 e. Some people accept this as part of the price of a $0 service they enjoy
  using. Others take care to block cookies\, and reduce the amount of perso
 nal data that third parties can gather about them.\n\nBut what information
  is really being collected when you are using the web? Where\, when and ho
 w is it being collected? Do those who agree to this data collection really
  know what they are handing over? And are those who don't agree having any
  success at protecting their personal data?\n\nI will show you how extensi
 ve is the information Facebook openly admits to collecting (if you know wh
 ere to look!)\, and how easy it is for Facebook to collect it without your
  knowledge. You will also see how third parties routinely gather your data
  from other websites\, in many cases without the website owner realising. 
 \n\nWe will look at a real world example by analysing a fairly typical web
 site of a well-known company that isn't known for its data collection\, to
  see what sorts of things it is sending to third parties. In addition\, yo
 u'll see the results of research into what those third parties use the dat
 a for.\n\nFinally I will discuss what you can do if you wish to better pro
 tect your personal data\, and some of the problems you may face\, includin
 g why deleting your cookies may be counter-productive.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Eduardo Silva\nLogging is one of the ancient mechanis
 m behavior to perform application or hardware analysis. In a new era of di
 stributed systems at scale and connected embedded devices\, data collectio
 n and processing becomes a real challenge\; Logging has been forced to evo
 lve and adapt to new needs. \n\nIn Data Analysis\, logging is one of the k
 ey components to collect and pre-process data\, usually\, a logging mechan
 ism goes through collect\, parse\, filter and centralize logs to a storage
  backend like a database\, so data processing and analysis can be performe
 d. This usually happens after the data has been aggregated and stored\, bu
 t for real-time analysis needs\, process the data while is still in motion
  brings a lot of advantages and this kind of approach is called Stream Pro
 cessing.\n \nWhat if it was possible to query your data using aggregation 
 functions\, windowing\, and grouping results while the data was in motion 
 and in-memory but on the edge side?.\n\nIn this presentation\, we will go 
 further and present an extended approach called 'Stream Processing on the 
 Edge'\, where data is processed on the edge service or device\, in a light
 weight mode empowering features like anomaly detection (in the order of mi
 lliseconds) and Machine Learning in a distributed way using pure Open Sour
 ce software.

 to ensure that our products are using that data for good. Treating the hum
 ans and communities we serve with respect. Behaving ethically both individ

  that businesses are only rewarded if they put profit first and customers 
 last. I refuse to accept this is true.\n\nThis talk provides an introducti

 our bottom line\, and explore some practical tips to build your ethical mu
 scles so we can build the kind of future we want to have\, that our childr

 ly shouldn't be massive\, nor should they include development tools\, and 
 it's probably unnecessary to run deployed integrations in a development en

 naming appropriately along the way.

 ts seem to have all these nice things\, like:\n \n - modern editors *gasp*
 \n - type-checked code completions\n - linters built-in to their editors\n
  - easy to use interactive debuggers\n - a giant matrix of configurations 
 and platforms tested on each commit automatically\n - many different kinds
  of test suites\n\nIn this session I'll show you that the kernel hasn't be
 en left that far behind\, and there's lots of awesome tools out there to m
 ake working on the kernel easier - whether they're the new hotness or an o
